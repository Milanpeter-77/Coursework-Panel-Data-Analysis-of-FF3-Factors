Then, I continue with extending the model to include the sector–factor interaction terms. Next, I estimate the fixed effects (FE) model using the within transformation to control for unobserved firm-specific effects. Finally, I estimate the random effects (RE) model via GLS, which assumes that firm-specific effects are uncorrelated with the regressors. In my implementation, I ran the pooled regression with `statsmodels`, regressing excess returns on the three Fama–French factors with a constant term. For the fixed effects and random effects models, I used the `linearmodels` package. This package provides a convenient way to estimate FE (applying the within transformation) and RE models using GLS."

The idea is that each firm may have its own average return level due to characteristics that do not change over time (e.g., business model, risk exposure, management style). If these unobserved firm traits are correlated with the factors, pooled OLS would give biased estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fixed effects specification is:\n",

The reason is that residuals for a given firm are likely to be serially correlated and heteroskedastic over time — shocks to a firm’s return today may carry over into future days. If I ignored this dependence and used conventional standard errors, the inference would be biased, typically underestimating the true variability of the estimates and overstating statistical significance."

    "The advantage of random effects is that it can be more efficient than fixed effects, since it uses both the within-firm and between-firm variation in the data. However, this efficiency gain relies on the strong assumption that the regressors are uncorrelated with the firm-specific effects. If this assumption fails, RE estimates will be biased.\n",

    "All four models deliver very similar explanatory power around 31%, with the interaction model edging the highest uncentered R-squared while fixed and random effects match on within and overall fit; however, pooled OLS is preferred by AIC/BIC among the OLS variants, and FE/RE provide the panel-decomposed diagnostics and clustered inference advantages. The robust F-statistics are huge and $p=0.000$ in every case, so joint significance holds across specifications.\n",

    "- Within/Overall: FE and RE both post $R^2_{\\text{within}}=0.3077$ and $R^2_{\\text{overall}}=0.3072$, indicating that the factors explain within-firm time variation similarly under either estimator.\n",

    "To compare the different models, I performed a series of statistical tests. First, I used F-tests to compare nested models: pooled OLS vs. pooled OLS with sector-specific slopes (interaction), fixed effects vs. pooled OLS, and fixed effects vs. pooled OLS with sector-specific slopes (interaction). These tests check whether the additional parameters in the more complex model significantly improve the fit. Next, I used the Hausman test to compare the fixed effects and random effects models. This test checks whether the difference in coefficients between the two models is systematic. If the test indicates correlation between regressors and firm effects, fixed effects is the consistent choice; otherwise, random effects can be used for efficiency."

    "A three-factor panel model explains within-firm daily excess returns well, fixed effects are required over pooled OLS, and random effects are supported by the Hausman test and preferred for efficiency; sector-specific slopes are individually significant but do not improve fit jointly over pooled slopes in this sample. Taken together, common factor betas are stable across estimators, firm intercept heterogeneity is material, and the RE specification with clustered errors is the recommended baseline for reporting and inference here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is one common β across firms reasonable, or should β vary by sector as in $y_{it} = \\alpha_i + f_t \\beta_s + \\epsilon_{it}$? The pooled baseline delivers $R^2 \\approx 0.307$, and allowing sector-specific slopes raises uncentered $R^2$ slightly to about $0.310$, but the nested $F$-test against pooled slopes is not significant overall (negative $F$, $p≈1$), so I do not adopt sector-specific betas as a superior general specification, despite significant sector coefficients individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do firm-specific intercepts matter? Yes, the $F$-test strongly rejects poolability in favor of fixed effects ($F≈8.699$, $p≈8.39e−182$), indicating that firms differ in average returns and those differences need to be controlled to avoid bias in slope estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "FE vs RE: which to use? The Hausman test does not reject RE ($H≈0.0013$, $p=1$), and FE and RE yield practically identical betas and $R^2_{\\text{within}}$, so I prefer Random Effects."
